Welcome to Traefik Hub's API Portal Template repository!

The repository is a starting point for building your own custom API Portal UI.

It includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that you can customize to match your branding and requirements.

## Getting started

To get started, fork this repository and modify the template to your liking.

Once modified, you will need to:

- Build the Docker image using `make image`
- Create a Kubernetes Deployment using the new image
- Expose this deployment behind a Kubernetes Service
- Update your APIPortal CRD and set the `spec.ui.service` field to the Kubernetes service

A sample Deployment and Service can be found in the [manifest.yaml](./manifest.yaml "Link to example manifest file") file.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ "Link to website of Docker")
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en "Link to website of Node.js") (at least Node 18)
- [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/ "Link to website of Yarn")
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Link to the website of Git")

## Development

1. Installing dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

2. Run the development server:

```shell
yarn start
```

The application is running at [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003 "Link to localhost on port 3003") in dev mode.

The local setup uses a Service Worker to intercept HTTP calls and inject a mocked reply.

This allows to test the application with mocked data and simulate different scenarios without relying on external APIs or services.

> Note that the Service Worker is only active in development mode.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```shell
yarn test
```

## Feedback

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us via our [support](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-hub/support/ "Link to support information") or GitHub issues.

We hope you find this template useful and look forward to seeing what you build with it!
